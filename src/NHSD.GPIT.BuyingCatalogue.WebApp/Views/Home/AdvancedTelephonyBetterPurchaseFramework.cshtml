        <p>
            The Advanced Telephony Better Purchasing framework allows commissioners to procure cloud-based telephone systems from a number of assured telephony suppliers within the Better Purchasing Framework List.
        </p>

        <p>
            Owned by the National Commercial and Procurement Hub, the list includes suppliers who meet a national cloud-based telephony specification and NHS terms and conditions.
        </p>

        <p>
            The framework offers commissioners support with requirements identification, procurement support, exit and migration support and supplier management.
        </p>

        <p>
            Later this year, the list will be replaced by the Digital Care Services Cloud Telephony framework. Until then, practices with urgent telephony solutions requirements, such as those whose contracts are coming to an end, can move forward with procurement using the list.
        </p>

        <p>
            Suppliers that are on the list will be pre-committed to the terms of the new Digital Care Services Cloud Telephony framework, prior to its launch. Buying organisations can therefore procure services from any of the suppliers with confidence in the capability of the advanced telephony solutions offered and the suppliers operating them.
        </p>

        </h2>

        <p>

        </p>

        <p>
            The framework will be built around the following Capabilities:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Auto-Attendant and Interactive Voice Response (IVR)</li>

            <li>Office Telephony</li>
            <li>Rule-based Call Routing</li>
        </ul>

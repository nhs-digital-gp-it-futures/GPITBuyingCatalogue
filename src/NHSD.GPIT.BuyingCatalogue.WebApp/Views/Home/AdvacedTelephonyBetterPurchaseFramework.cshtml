        <p>
            The Advanced Telephony Better Purchasing framework allows commissioners to procure cloud-based telephone systems from a number of assured telephony suppliers within the Better Purchasing Framework List.
        </p>

        <p>
            Owned by the National Commercial and Procurement Hub, the list includes suppliers who meet a national cloud-based telephony specification and NHS terms and conditions.
        </p>

        <p>
            The framework offers commissioners support with requirements identification, procurement support, exit and migration support and supplier management.
        </p>

        <p>
            Later this year, the list will be replaced by the Digital Care Services Cloud Telephony framework. Until then, practices with urgent telephony solutions requirements, such as those whose contracts are coming to an end, can move forward with procurement using the list.
        </p>

        <p>
            Suppliers that are on the list will be pre-committed to the terms of the new Digital Care Services Cloud Telephony framework, prior to its launch. Buying organisations can therefore procure services from any of the suppliers with confidence in the capability of the advanced telephony solutions offered and the suppliers operating them.

            Digital Care Services Cloud Telephony framework
        </h4>

        <p>
            The Digital Care Services Cloud Telephony framework is planned to launch in spring 2023. It will set the strategic technical and commercial direction for future services, as well as the standard for unified communications and telephony services in general practice and primary care.
        </p>

        <p>
            The Digital Care Services Cloud Telephony framework will support practices, Primary Care Networks and their Integrated Care Boards in commissioning advanced GP telephony systems built around cloud-hosted Voiceover IP (VoIP) systems, which include clinical system integration, remote access and peak demand management capabilities.
        </p>

        <p>
            The framework will be built around the following Capabilities:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Auto-Attendant and Interactive Voice Response (IVR)</li>
            <li>Call History</li>
            <li>Office Telephony</li>
            <li>Rule-based Call Routing</li>
            <li>Video Consultation</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            It is being planned for implementation before the end of the first quarter of financial year 2023 to 2024.

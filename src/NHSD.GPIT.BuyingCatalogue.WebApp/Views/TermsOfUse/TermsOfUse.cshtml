            <p>
                The Buying Catalogue is a tool to support the call-off procurement processes for products and services established by specific framework agreements.
                It helps you conduct pre-procurement market research and, once you register,
                enables you to compare and select digital solutions and services offered by suppliers and available for purchase via regulated framework agreements (known as <b>"Catalogue Solutions"</b>).    
            </p>

            <h3>1.3</h3>
            <p>
                These terms of use set out the standards that apply when you access the Buying Catalogue,
                use it to support call-off procurement processes for Catalogue Solutions, and (if the functionality is made available) add content to the Buying Catalogue,
                make contact with other users on the Buying Catalogue, link to the Buying Catalogue, or interact with it in any other way.

        <p>As you’ve agreed some specific requirements for your Associated Services with the supplier, you need to document them.
            You can do this by downloading and completing <a href="https://gpitbjss.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/BG/pages/12209684600/Order+form+appendix+2+Associated+Service+billing+and+requirements" target="_blank">section 2 of Appendix 2: Associated Services billing and requirements (opens in a new tab)</a></p>
        <p>This document must be included when you send your order to the supplier. You can download it now or after you’ve completed your order. </p>

            <p>You can browse the Buying Catalogue and select any solution you want to order.</p>
            <p>Your contract value should include everything you intend to spend.</p>
            <p>It would not, for example, be acceptable to execute a number of Direct Awards to the same supplier to avoid carrying out a competition.</p>

            <h2>For orders between £40k and £250k (excluding VAT)</h2>
            <p>You must carry out a competition of similar solutions using information available on the Buying Catalogue. Score solutions based on how they perform against certain criteria, for example, price, implementation timescales or service levels.</p>
            <p>When executing a competition, you cannot create requirements that result in a shortlist of one Catalogue Solution.</p>

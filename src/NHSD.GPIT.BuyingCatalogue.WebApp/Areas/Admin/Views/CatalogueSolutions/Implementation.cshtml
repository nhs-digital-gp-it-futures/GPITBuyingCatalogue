                    The following is an example of a good answer:<br /><br />
                    Implementations without transition from another Catalogue
                    Solution typically take 3-5 working days, the average is 4. The
                    extent of your configuration requirements will have the greatest
                    impact on these timescales. Your main responsibility will be
                    configuration planning and approval.<br /><br />

                    Implementations with transition from another Catalogue Solution
                    typically take 6-10 working days, the average is 7. The data
                    structures and format will have the greatest impact on these
                    timescales, as will the extent of local configuration.<br /><br />

                    If we have previously completed a transition from your outgoing
                    supplier for another service recipient, the timescales are more
                    likely to be shorter. We will expect you to cleanse your data
                    before migration and to participate in testing.

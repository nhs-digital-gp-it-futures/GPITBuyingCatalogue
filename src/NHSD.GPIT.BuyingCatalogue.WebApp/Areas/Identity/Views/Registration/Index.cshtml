                    You can request an account on the Buying Catalogue using our online form. You'll need to provide the following information: Your name, telephone number, email address, the name of your organisation and its ODS code if you know it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Currently we can only set up account for staff from Clinical Commissioning Groups or Commissioning Support Units.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once we've set up your account, you'll be sent a link to the email address you provide so you can create a password. The link can be used only once to set up an account, and will be valid for 24 hours from the time you receive the email.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Buying Catalogue Team aims to respond to account requests within 5 working days.

                    If for any reason the button does not work, you can send your details to buying.catalogue@nhs.net with the subject line: Buying Catalogue account request.

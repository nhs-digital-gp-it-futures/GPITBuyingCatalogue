Through innovative IT we help healthcare professionals access the information they need to provide better, faster and more cost effective patient care.

This all came from one idea shared by two GPs: that technology can be used to give clinicians access to complete and shared medical records, no matter where patients present for care.

Our clinical software is now used in all major healthcare settings from GP surgeries to pharmacies, hospitals, and specialist community services. By providing innovative, integrated solutions, we’re working to break the boundaries of system integration and interoperability.
